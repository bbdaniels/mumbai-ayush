Table 1B: Case Interactions in Experimental and Observational Cohort
This table  shows the number of times each case scenario was presented to the (i)Control and Treatment groups of the Experimental Cohort and to the (ii)PPIA and Non-PPIA groups of the Observational Cohort in baseline and in endline.

Table 2: Changes in quality of care indicators across rounds for the Observational Cohort
This table reports the regression estimate of the difference in mean outcomes of quality of care indicators for TB cases between baseline and endline for the Observational Cohort, its standard error and p value. The regression estimate is the linear regression coefficient of the study round (baseline/endline), controlling for the type of group (4 types according to a provider’s participation in the PPIA program in the 2 rounds) and the case scenario. The first two columns report the mean of quality of care outcomes in baseline and in endline for the Observational Cohort. Standard errors are clustered at the individual provider level.

Table3
Table 3: Balance tests for control and treatment groups using balance, process and quality of care indicators.
This table reports the mean and standard error of balance, process and quality of care indicators from 579 standardized patient interactions in baseline for the Experimental Cohort. It then reports the differences in the means of these indicators between the control and treatment groups and tests for statistical significance of these differences. This is done by assessing the linear regression coefficient of trial assignment (control or treatment) after controlling for case scenario. Standard errors are clustered at the individual provider level.

Table4A
Table 4A: Effect of PPIA program on quality of care indicators
This table reports the treatment effect of the PPIA program (both intention-to treat and treatment-on-the-treated due to incomplete compliance) on quality of care indicators for the Experimental Cohort, its standard error and p-value. Only TB cases have been included while estimating the treatment effect as the asthma case was not presented in baseline. The ITT effect is estimated as the linear regression coefficient of interaction between the round (baseline/endline) and trial assignment of the provider (control/treatment), controlling for the round, trial assignment and case scenario. The TOT effect is estimated as the linear regression coefficient of interaction between the round(baseline/endline) and the actual treatment of the provider, controlling for the round, actual treatment and case scenario. It uses trial assignment as an instrumental variable for actual treatment and uses interaction of trial assignment and round as an instrumental variable for interaction of actual treatment and round. The first four columns report  the mean of quality of care outcomes for control and treatment groups in baseline and in endline for all the TB case scenarios. Standard errors are clustered at the individual healthcare provider.

Table4B
Fig 4B: Effect of engaging providers in PPIA facilities on quality of care indicators for the asthma
This table reports  the treatment effect of the PPIA program (both intention-to treat and treatment-on-the-treated due to incomplete compliance) on quality of care indicators of the asthma case for the Experimental Cohort, its standard error and p-value. The ITT effect is estimated as the linear regression coefficient of trial assignment of the provider at baseline(control/treatment), controlling for case scenario. The TOT effect is estimated as the linear regression coefficient of the actual treatment of the provider irrespective of their trial assignment at baseline, controlling case scenario. It uses trial assignment at baseline as an instrumental variable for actual treatment. The first two columns report the mean of quality of care outcomes for control and treatment groups for the asthma case. Standard errors are clustered at the individual healthcare provider.

Figure 1. Quality of care in Observational Cohort Mumbai AYUSH providers in Baseline and Endline rounds
This figure shows the mean of correct management, whether the provider recommended a referral and whether the provider recommended a chest x-ray for the 4 groups of the Observational cohort: those who entered, exited, remained in, or remained out of the PPIA between the two study rounds.

Figure 2:Sensitivity and specificity of standardized patients measurements across time and case scenario
This figure shows sensitivity and specificity levels for quality of care indicators for TB case 1 in endline; treating outcomes of TB case 1 as a clinical test and outcomes of the asthma case as the ground truth.
This figure shows sensitivity and specificity levels for quality of care indicators for TB case 1; treating outcomes in baseline as a clinical test and outcomes in endline as the ground truth.

TableA1
APPENDIX Table: Case scenario interactions across baseline and endline
This table shows the total number of providers that belonged to one of the groups: not presented the case, presented the case only in endline, presented the case only in baseline, presented the case in both the rounds, for every case scenario in the Experimental (control and treatment) and the Observational (PPIA and Non-PPIA) cohort.

TableA2
APPENDIX Table: Naive difference in differences estimate for the Observational Cohort
This table reports a naive difference in differences regression estimate for the effect of the PPIA program on the quality of care outcomes of the TB cases for the Observational Cohort, its standard error and p-value. The effect is estimated as the linear regression coefficient of the treatment status (considered treated if a provider joined the PPIA network), its standard error and p-values, controlling the round (baseline/endline), case scenario and engagement group. The first four columns report the mean of quality of care outcomes for each of the engagement groups of the Observational Cohort(4 groups according to a provider’s participation in the PPIA program in the 2 rounds). Standard errors are clustered at the individual healthcare provider level.
